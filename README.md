 ## Flight Etiquette Data Analysis

I chose the question: Is it rude to say more than a few words to the stranger sitting next to you on a plane?

I picked this question because I was curious about flight etiquette when it comes to strangers. I typically strike up conversations with strangers next to me—when appropriate—so I was interested in finding out if this was a divisive concept. The bar chart proves that an overwhelming majority of people do not find it rude to chat with strangers on a plane. 180 people find it slightly or very rude to talk with strangers, and 675 people do not find it rude at all. 

I found this data set interesting because of the detailed analysis of the respondents. Characteristics about each respondent were recorded, and it is interesting to analyze how people's identifying traits change their behavior on a flight. For example, someone with kids is more likely to be sympathetic to a crying child. Or, a taller person is probably more likely to recline their chair or stand up more often on the flight. Having this information puts the data into perspective.
